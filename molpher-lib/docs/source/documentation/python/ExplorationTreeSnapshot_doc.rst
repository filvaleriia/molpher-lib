ExplorationTreeSnapshot
=======================

.. py:currentmodule:: molpher.swig_wrappers.core

.. autoclass:: ExplorationTreeSnapshot

    .. warning::  Despite its signature, this class does not have
        a constructor so do not attempt to instantiate it.
        An `AttributeError` will be raised, if you do.

    Handles saving and loading of a serializable data structure which represents a state of an
    `ExplorationTree`. It can be passed to `ExplorationTree.createFromSnapshot()`, which then returns
    an appropriate `ExplorationTree` instance.

    .. note:: Only the morphing parameters and the `exploration tree` itself will be serialized.
         If there are any pending `candidate morphs` that were not attached to the tree, they will
         be discarded before the `ExplorationTreeSnapshot` is generated by `ExplorationTree.createSnapshot()`.

    .. automethod:: load(path)

        Attempts to create an `ExplorationTreeSnapshot` from a ``path``.

        :param path: path to the saved snapshot
        :type path: `str`
        :return: An `ExplorationTreeSnapshot` instance.
        :rtype: `ExplorationTreeSnapshot`

    .. automethod:: save(path)

        Saves an `ExplorationTreeSnapshot` file to a given ``path``.

        :param path: path to the saved snapshot
        :type path: `str`
