Molpher C++ API
===============

.. warning:: This section is under construction at the moment so the information contained within
      is often missing or incomplete. However, the Python API very closely follows the C++ implementation
      and the facilities are very similar to those described in `the description of python modules <molpher>`.

This section contains the description of various C++ facilities available to users who
wish to access the functionality of Molpher using C++. It also gives information
on how to compile and run your own programs.

All the header files described in this section of the documentation
are located in the :file:`include/` folder of the `Molpher-lib project`.
