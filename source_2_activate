# source this file inside this directory to activate the development environment:
# - build and install the binaries in the default 'dist' directory with the "molpher_install" target
# - you can then source this file and build the appropriate Python plugin for your distribution:
#        python setup.py build_ext --inplace
# - after that the molpher module and rdkit should both be available in Python
