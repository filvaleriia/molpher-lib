# This file contains all steps needed to build the python package from source and test it in Python
# source this file inside this directory to activate the development environment (you can create the environment using the "environment.yml" file):
# here are the steps needed to build the python package and use it in python:
# 1. build and install the binaries in the default 'dist' directory with the "molpher_install" target
# 2. source this file and build the appropriate Python plugin for your distribution:
#        python setup.py build_ext --inplace
# 3. after that the "molpher" and "rdkit" modules from the "deps" directory should both be available in Python

conda activate molpher-lib-build
