Tutorial
========

The tutorial is structured so that it proceeds from the most basic concepts
and building blocks to recreating the implementation of the original
chemical space exploration algorithm published in [1]_. The last part
then showcases some of the new algorithms developed with Molpher-lib
and explains how to use them with some simple usage examples.
