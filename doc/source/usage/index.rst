Using the library
=================

This section introduces users to the library and explains all important concepts and terminology.
It contains notes on how to install the library and a tutorial which
demonstrates all of the core features on various examples.

..  note:: This section only describes the Python portion of the library. However, the Python API tightly follows the C++ implementation so most of
        the concepts described below can be easily applied to C++ as well.
