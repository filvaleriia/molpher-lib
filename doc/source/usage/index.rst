Using the library
=================

This section explains most of the functionality available in the library.
It contains notes on how to install it and a tutorial which
demonstrates all of the core features on various examples.

..  note:: This section only describes the Python portion of the library. However, the Python API tightly follows the C++ implementation so most of
        the concepts described below can be easily applied to C++ as well. Additionally,
        most of the classes discussed here implement the same methods as the corresponding C++ classes.
