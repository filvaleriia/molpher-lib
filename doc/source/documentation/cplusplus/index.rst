.. warning:: This section is under construction at the moment so the information contained within
      is often missing or incomplete. However, the Python API very closely follows the C++ implementation
      and the facilities are very similar to those described in :mod:`the description of python modules <molpher>`.

This section contains the description of various C++ facilities available to users who
wish to access the functionality of Molpher using C++. It also gives information
on how to compile and run your own programs.
